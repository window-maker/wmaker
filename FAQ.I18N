If I18N support does not work for you, check these:

	- the LANG environment variable is set to your locale, and 
	  the locale is supported by your OS's locale or X's locale
	  emulation. you can display all supported locales by 
	  executing "locale -a" command if it available. and you
	  can check if your locale is supported by X's locale emulation.
	  See "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/locale.alias"

	- Check if you're using appropriate fonts for the locale you
	  chose. If you're using a font set that has a different 
	  encoding than the one used by Xlib or libc, bad things can
	  happen. Try specifically putting the encoding in the LANG 
	  variable, like ru_RU.KOI8-R. Again, see
	  "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/locale.alias"

	- if your OS doesn't support any locale or if your OS doesn't 
 	  support a locale for your language, you can use X Window System's
	  locale emulation feature instead of OS's locale. To use this
	  feature, add this option to the configure, "--with-x-locale".
	  if your OS is commercial one, such as Solaris,IRIX,AIX,...,
	  you perhaps don't have to use X's locale emulation.
	  But if your OS is Linux or NetBSD or .. , it's possible
	  your locale is not supported so far. then use "--with-x-locale".

	  Note: to use X's locale emulation, your Xlib has to be
	        compiled so that the locale emulation is enabled.
	        Linux RedHat5.0's default Xlib is not compiled 
		like that. (RH4.x are ok). Recompiled Xlib for
		RH5.0 where you can use locale emulation is available
		here:
		ftp://ftp.linux.or.jp/pub/RPM/glibc

	- if you'd like to display multibyte characters, set the
	  MultiByteText option to YES in ~/GNUstep/Defaults/WindowMaker
	  and ~/GNUstep/Defaults/WMGLOBAL

	- the fonts you're using support your locale. if your font
	  setting on $HOME/GNUstep/Defaults/WindowMaker is like..

	  WindowTitleFont = "-*-helvetica-bold-r-normal-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*";
	  MenuTitleFont = "-*-helvetica-bold-r-normal-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*";
	  ......................................................

	  then you can't display non iso8859-x charcters by helvetica. 
	  so quick way to display various languages' font is to change
	  all the font settings into:
	  
		"-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

	  and also you need to change font settings in style files in
	  the "$HOME/Library/WindowMaker/Style" directory.

	- the LC_CTYPE environment variable is unset or it has the correct
          value. If you don't know what is the correct value, unset it.
