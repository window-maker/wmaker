- fixed some bugs in text field

- added a slider
- changed the filepanel stuff. Each application can have only 1 file panel.
The same panel will be reused every time you call for it, unless you free it.

  font can't be loaded

  when no options are selected

  not good practice to change the contents of a popup button when it's
  already visible and the user has probably interacted with it.

  program
