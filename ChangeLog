  This avoids a crashing bug if an image for spixmap or tpixmap is not found.
- Fixed some missing parameter in a call to wWarning() in texture.c which could
  have caused hazardous (even crash) behavior if the pixmap image for texture
  was not found.
- Fixed code in session handling, to save only one entry for applications with
  multiple windows opened on screen.
- Implemented option to allow miniwindows to be workspace specific. It is named
  WorkspaceTiedMiniWindows = Yes/No; It is set in WindowMaker domain. Read NEWS
- Fixed bug with incorrect height restoral of window when unshading requested
  from client.
- Fixed problem with solid IconBack.
- Fixed problem with hardcoded /usr/local. The value given to configure with
  --prefix=/some/path is now used.

- Many fixes to moveres.c.
- Put all the keys from defaults.c in WindowMaker domain database. 
- Fixed a crashing bug when workspace names were as long (or longer) as
  MAX_WORKSPACENAME_WIDTH (16 characters). In this case a right click on a
  window title caused WindowMaker to crash.
- Included support for detecting if system requires to include libxpg4, which
  is needed by some FreeBSD systems, when using --enable-kanji.
- Some fixes to configure.in and some Makefile.am files to allow the use of
  VPATH feature of 'make', which will let the source and build directories to
  be separate.
- Changed the application launching code, so it put fork()-ed processes in
  process groups of their own, to avoid locking of entire session, due to a
  badly configure launching child. Only for systems which have setpgrp().
  This is autodetected by configure, and used if available, else it will revert
  to old behavior.
- Added the AutoCollapse feature to clip. This (when set) will allow the clip
  to stay collapsed, and show when moving the mouse over it. When the mouse

  with click on title-bar. Meta click on titlebar will lower them.
- Fixes in moveres.c to allow a smoother draw of frames while moving and
  resizing windows.
- Fixed a problem when resizing with Meta+RightClick.
- Fixed a bug that freezed WindowMaker when dragging a window from one
  workspace to other, with OpaqueMove = No;

  icons.
