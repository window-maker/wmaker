  have caused hazardous (even crash) behavior if the pixmap image for texture
  was not found.
- Fixed code in session handling, to save only one entry for applications with
  multiple windows opened on screen.
- Implemented option to allow miniwindows to be workspace specific. It is named
  WorkspaceTiedMiniWindows = Yes/No; It is set in WindowMaker domain. Read NEWS

  from client.
- Fixed problem with solid IconBack.

- Many fixes to moveres.c.
- Put all the keys from defaults.c in WindowMaker domain database. 
- Fixed a crashing bug when workspace names were as long (or longer) as
  MAX_WORKSPACENAME_WIDTH (16 characters). In this case a right click on a
  window title caused WindowMaker to crash.
- Included support for detecting if system requires to include libxpg4, which
  is needed by some FreeBSD systems, when using --enable-kanji.
- Some fixes to configure.in and some Makefile.am files to allow the use of
  VPATH feature of 'make', which will let the source and build directories to
  be separate.
- Changed the application launching code, so it put fork()-ed processes in
  process groups of their own, to avoid locking of entire session, due to a
  badly configure launching child. Only for systems which have setpgrp().
  This is autodetected by configure, and used if available, else it will revert
  to old behavior.
- Added the AutoCollapse feature to clip. This (when set) will allow the clip
  to stay collapsed, and show when moving the mouse over it. When the mouse
  leaves it, it will collapse back after a delay. Read NEWS.

  with click on title-bar. Meta click on titlebar will lower them.
- Fixes in moveres.c to allow a smoother draw of frames while moving and
  resizing windows.
- Fixed a problem when resizing with Meta+RightClick.
- Fixed a bug that freezed WindowMaker when dragging a window from one

  icons.

- libPropList is no more part of distribution. You need to have it installed
  or else you need to download it and compile. See INSTALL file.
- Added Manome Tomonori's patch to fix kanji supprot. This added a new
  option to configure: --with-x-locale. See INSTALL and FAQ for more info.

  This way the appicon will not slip to the bottom left corner at the first
  touch, but let you first unhide the window.
- Fixed icon box position when dock on the left side. Now dock will not cover
  the app-icons.
- Fixed typo in application.c that inverted instance and class, thus making
  instance.class options saved in WMWindowAttributes unavailable.
- Added option SelectKey in WindowMaker config file, that lets one bind a
  key to select/unselect the focused window. Also the same option added
  to the window menu. SelectKey = "some_key_bind";

  portability.
- Fixed window to not place themselves under dock if dock on the left side
  and auto/cascade mode is used.

  shadowed window.

  in WWindowAttributes structure to 1.
