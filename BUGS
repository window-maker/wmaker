- wmaker will not stop managing a screen even if another window manager
  requests that, through the ICCCM 2.0 manager selection stuff
- stacking code is buggy (or XFree is buggy)
- after restart focus is losed or switched to another window. May be related
  to the one above.
- save session doesnt work on some platforms (Alpha and Sparc)
- texture pixmaps are being incorrectly freed somewhere. Either
  fix bug (to support broken MetroX servers) or remove all useless references
  to the Pixmap (to save memory and drop bug compatibility).
- host information is not saved/honored by the dock or save session stuff.
  It should at least check if the host is the local machine and only save it
  in the session/allow docking it if yes.
- the SHELL environment variable support in the apps menu was removed
  because of a problem with tcsh. If ~/.tcshrc contains "stty erase ^H",
  it will block and the cmd will not be executed. 
- mouse grab being done in client window (in wWindowResetMouseGrabs())
  instead of the frame window. If grab is done in frame, titlebar buttons
  dont work well

- mysterious mess in dock icons (specially netscape)
